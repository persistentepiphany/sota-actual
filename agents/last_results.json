Palantir's Product Development organisation is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product.

Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you\u2019re a former university Teaching Assistant, switched to computer science recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast \u2014 you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem.
